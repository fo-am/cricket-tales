  <h1>ABOUT THE PROJECT</h1>

  <hr class="bottom">

  <p>
    In a secret field in Northern Spain, 300 cricket burrows are monitored
    using CCTV. This is the first long-term study of behaviour in a wild
    insect, and we need your help to see what the crickets are up to.

    By tagging events in these videos, you contribute directly to research,
    enabling a better understanding of the crickets' personalities and how
    their lives progress. This helps us to find out more about animal
    behaviour and the ageing process.
